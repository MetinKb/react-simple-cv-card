                Hello everyone! This is Metin. I am 19 years old. I am a senior student at Manisa Celal Bayar University's Computer Programming department. I am taking firm steps towards becoming a full-stack web developer. My goal is to have advanced knowledge in the MERN technology stack and to improve myself by increasing my level of English language and to push my limits in this field.
